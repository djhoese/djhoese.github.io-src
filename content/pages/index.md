My name is David Hoese. I'm a software engineer working at the Space Science
and Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. At the
SSEC I work with meteorological satellite data and ground-based station
instruments.

Below you'll find links to various projects that I work on as well as the blog
hosted on this site. The blog is a test to see if I can get myself to bundle
enough information in to posts and find the time to actually write something
down.
